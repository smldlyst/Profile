### Awards
- Improvement of KB commercial area analysis & Development of Market fit indicator, for small business owners (2018) / Seoul National University **(Excellence Prize)**

### Core Competency
1. Model fit
 : I often use R's 'caret', 'h2o' packages to fit various machine learning models, and I have studied the theoretical background of most models. For regression/classification problems, I can properly develop predictive models. and also able to analyze data through Python, SAS, and SPSS.

1. Model deployment **[I can service machine learning models to customers and collaborate with developers.]**  
 : I have experience in developing a recommendation system through R's recosystem package, and I can deploy a model that can upload the plumber API to GCP through docker. 

1. Visualization app development **[I can provide analysis results in the form of an interaction graph and implement a prototype app.]**  
 : I have experience developing visualization prototype apps using R Shiny. This app provides an interaction graph representing the predicted value according to the action of the user interface. In addition, it can be visualized using geographic information.
