#### Comment
Hello, I am a student hoping to find a job in data analysis in Korea in 2023.
and I am interested in using Machine Learning based on Statistics.

My differentiated abilities are:

- Model fit
: I use R's caret package to fit various machine learning models, and I have studied the theoretical background of most models.  
In addition, strategies for the optimized model can be established.

- Model deployment
: I have experience in developing a recommendation system through R's recosystem package,  
and I can distribute a model that can upload the plumber API to GCP through docker.

- Visualization app development
: I can also deal with map data in R, and I have experience in visualizing interactive graphs that provide a user interface through R Shiny.
